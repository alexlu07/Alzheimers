41,1,@kilmeade The way @JoeBiden is that of a person with dementia! I know because my mother-in-law lived with us 7 yrs with it and my mother has it now! I know what it looks and acts like! All these things he can is doing are class signs! I have no doubt!
42,1,"@FloofSpikey I recall when my mom  passed I felt her passing I was on my way to my daughters she had Alzheimer’s disease and she had wilted away to nothing bless her her heart, but a few days afterwards I was fretting and I called out to her mom where r u I can’t feel u r u ok? Shortly 2)"

44,1,"Having buried my dad (who had dementia) this year, this was a helpful article."
45,1,@ThatSchoolcraft When mom got dementia our roles in life reversed. We were very close and aiding her in her final yrs was the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.
47,1,"@TheSweetKat It’s so hard.  Alzheimer’s took my grandma long before she actually passed.  I feel for you.  I wasn’t primary, but your comment resonates.  I remember her losing her grip on logic and reality, and fighting the help we were offering.  It was heartbreaking.  *hugs*"
49,1,"@DirtyFaceTreeHo Many years ago, in the early stages of my dad's dementia, my parents stayed in my ""granny flat"" and the old Pyr I had then would go to their door several times a day, each time my father would think he'd forgotten AGAIN to walk the dog and off they'd go.

Dogs, man 🤣🤣"
52,1,"Today I get to see the man, the myth, the legend that is my Dad for the first time in 15 months.
Hopefully his alzheimers hasn’t got much worse &amp; we can still talk about Buddy Holly, football &amp; what an “horrendous noise” I make on the guitar. (Hes not heard my violin playing yet)"
53,1,@RealityRecaps My parents both had dementia also religious...my dad gave me the finger once and I about died 😆
54,1,@JoyceWhiteVance @atrupar And paranoia is often a side effect of dementia. We saw it in my father.
56,1,"Mom just got another call from those scammers, she's 82 w/Dementia! This time he said her address while he was on speaker. She told him to call me so I can trace his IP thru VIOP! If you wanna get in on the fun of scarring the Shit out of him, here's the number: 412-627-5633 🤬🤬"

62,1,"@MarisolVaz8 I’m so sorry. I lost my dad to Alzheimer’s too. I knew when he thought I was his sister he was having a bad day, when he knew it was me it was a good day. It’s a horrible, sad thing to happen to anybody. ❤️"
65,1,Happy Mother’s Day Mom. I can’t wait to see you and give you a hug again soon. Not going to lie it’s pretty upsetting not being able to see you considering time is fading your memories with Alzheimer’s. I hope you see you again soon. https://t.co/v2Zv7XNFXK
66,1,"When I call my grandma she thinks I’m one of my cousins but then complains to my mom that I never call 😩 She has dementia so even if I correct her about who I am when I call, she immediately forgets &amp; goes back to thinking I’m someone else."

68,1,"@KalchikValeriy Two times. Once to see my dementia dad inside with masks for the first time in over a year. He had to get the vaccine to stay at his care facility. Hard decision because we can't take care of him, his needs are too high. And a funeral for one of my closest family friends."
69,1,"This story is close to my heart. I lost my grandpa to dementia, I wrote this for him. Excited to finally be able share it with the world."
70,1,@RecycleGrrl I’m so glad my mom is cool with grandcats/granddogs and my only grandmother who would have given a shit developed Alzheimer’s before I was of appropriate baby making age.
71,1,"@MaaloufMD One my brothers bitched at me for having 2 litres of Marble Slab delivered to Dad's LTC. I politely said that he won't get it all at once &amp; the staff can have some too. What I thought was he's 90 soon, has Alzheimer's, &amp; lost 30 lbs. He can have ice cream.

78,1,"My heart is heavy today.  After a 3-yr battle with Alzheimer’s, my sweet mum passed away last night.  This horrible disease just wrecked my poor mother, but I will always cherish her love and unfailing kindness no matter what life threw at her. Rest In Peace mum ❤️ https://t.co/zZLMZvjOTe"
79,1,@SeanFulce2040 @Kiss_My_Mask @JoeBiden Absolutely not. My dad had dementia and the signs are fckn blatant. I also believe that he's in the early stages of Parkinson's. Watch his gait. He does what he's told.
80,1,@Elenaforever13 @BreitbartNews My mom died of Alzheimer’s. In her early stages she had outburst of anger as well.
83,1,"@MarisolVaz8 I'm sorry.  I've been dealing with my father's dementia/memory loss since my mom died last year. It's difficult, even though we know it's part of aging, to see those who we relied on for so much of our youth to become this way. Stay strong, keep the love."
84,1,@MrWillis23 I'm good with it. I believe in an afterlife. Like to think after dad's dementia and forgetting mom in the end that they reconnected somewhere and continue their great love story there.
85,1,"@sarahkbingler I am grateful to Lakeridge Health Oshawa that I could stay with my 97 yo mom with dementia when she was in hospital for 6 days with broken femur. It took about 2 minutes for them to see that I could help them, and her."
86,1,Some people may not know this but i started writing because of my grandmother. When she got alzheimers a lot of things changed around my life and i didn't know how to express them until i learned how to write. I found this link from my old CV two of the stories here...
87,1,"My Mom mom has been deteriorating quickly with her diabetes and dementia this week. One of the most influential people in my life for certain. Patient, understanding, kind, supportive. All of the good qualities. Literally none of the bad ones. https://t.co/crg9fqsxBD"
90,1,"@DEFendFURiously That if I get dementia, like my mom, I will forget my amazing husband &amp; will look for my ex husband every day. That would be hell for both of us."
91,1,"@shuboogie My Dad has dementia. I might buy some bright plastic tableware and see if there is any impact.  He’s in hospice now, party because he doesn’t eat as much as he used to."
92,1,@CourtneeHendrix That's how I feel about my grandma. She has really bad dementia so....this is going to sound bad but to me she's already dead. She's a shell of her former self so when she's officially gone I think I'll be relieved that she no longer has to live like that.
94,1,"Life is so bittersweet. Nursing home called me to say they are starting the palliative care process for my beautiful mum as I waited in line to get my first Covid jab. Dementia is a bitch. Hug your mumma tight if you still have a mother you cherish

96,1,"@RadicalDemocra6 @AmitAryaMD My husband has dementia but he has frequently stated that he would rather die than go into an LTC. To keep profits and occupancy up, the government will make sure that he will be denied his wish."
98,1,@shuboogie Another definition for anamnesis is “the remembering of things from a supposed previous existence (often used with reference to Platonic philosophy).” This sounds like it might fit with the Alzheimer’s angle. My dad battled that terrible disease for 11 years. He died a year ago.
99,1,Reflecting on #DyingMattersAwarenessWeek my mum died of Lewy Body Dementia.  She was 57 when diagnosed and she died aged 62 we never knew what her end of life preferences were as it was never discussed.  I didn’t know what music or flowers she wanted at her funeral https://t.co/alZbwEGvoB
100,1,"@monaeltahawy It's terrible to lose a loved one, my condolences. I lost my grandmother last year - complications of dementia, not Covid, but lockdown made it near impossible for anyone to be with her. This pandemic has taken too much from us. My love to you. I'm so sorry."
102,1,"Don't know who needs to see it or hear/read it an maybe I'm just venting.
But if you have a family member with Alzheimer's or dementia DONT FUCKING TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. 
TLDR I fucking hate my my Uncle for this very reason an with his own mother."
103,1,"@RyanMarino Also had severe vascular dementia.  But due to corporate policy, her PCP made her come in every month just to see her and get an RX. It was so exhausting for my grandmother. Over 4 hours of prep/appt and lots of coaxing for that RX so she wouldn't be in pain 🤬"

106,1,@apnelson1 I lost my grandpa to dementia. I used to be his carer. I seen him go through times where he walks about from 5am from my room to dad's room 10 times a day. He didn't know where he was. Unfortunately he died 3 years ago. He stopped walking eating an drinking.
107,1,@sueypudding @KirstieMAllsopp My mother died from Alzheimers 30th May last year in a care home. I’m glad she did. This year without contract would have killed her anyway. ☹️
108,1,@culpd8 Such a horrible disease. And it doesn’t appear that the medical profession is actively pursuing a cure. I lost my dad to Alzheimer’s 😢
109,1,"@FarmChicJodi I am sorry. My father had Alzheimer's. So I know some of what you are going through.

My thoughts are with you. Good luck."
111,1,A year ago today my lovely mom passed away from dementia.  What’s amazing is that she never lost her appreciation for music even when she had forgotten all else.
112,1,"If my father who was diagnosed with alzheimer’s this year can pray all of his prayers  when he doesn’t remember most things, what’s our excuse?"
113,1,@tedcruz Hahaha lol. If he wasn’t such vindictive anti American old goat this is sad. My mother in law started w/mild dementia long time &amp; it slowly moves to very senile. Alzheimer’s she sadly died 3 Wk’s once diagnosed. Jill especially + close family should be in jail for elder abuse.
114,1,"My husband and kids went to see my MIL, I'm with my mom who is still sleeping, I don't think I'll see her this mother's day.  Mom has dementia, sometimes she's up 48hrs and down for another 24."

123,1,"@NickyPearson65 Those times are difficult and precious. I didn't take enough time to spend with my mum before her dementia progressed to the point that she was non-verbal. It is one of the biggest regrets, yet the picture on my desk of her and me is also one of my biggest inspirations."
125,1,"@_Embo @CharlieEve5 @AlzResearchUK No wish list Storm, but what a wonderful gesture. Alzheimer's is such a horror show. My sister is in decline with it. 👋👋👋👋"
127,1,"@DrKatyBarnett @a_swift_half I’m so sorry to hear that. My grandmother on my mum’s side was similar, and looking back the decline apparently began in middle age. It’s insidious and frightened my mum for many years. If there’s something to loath more than cancer it’s dementia."
130,1,@LittleMissLizz My dad died in 2017 from early onset Alzheimer's and the absolute rage I feel in my heart for people on the internet being terrible cannot be fully expressed.

598,1,@DinaTho61271144 My mother died from Alzheimer's. Are you talking about generalized dementia or Alzheimer's? They are different. Alzheimer's causes dementia but dementia can happen without Alzheimer's. In any case it is very hard to watch.

619,1,@harpers_da my mum was everything but after she got dementia she was very hard to love. I can relate about not having a relationship. Just because it’s Mother’s Day it doesn’t mean you have to go with it. After all it’s just another huge marketing day for flowers

1662,1,My grandfather is no longer entitled to a medical card because my grandmother who had dementia passed on with covid. Apparently his pension is too much. He's a 69 year old man with health complications and a mortgage to pay. @DonnellyStephen  your actual living trash

But for my dad this must suck so much..."
1687,1,"@GMB thank you for discussing with @MattHancock social care reform. I do hope they deliver on this, my story with my Mum who has dementia has been so distressing. It’s time our elderly get the care they need and not have to sell their homes after working for most of their lives"
1688,1,do yall know what a fucking joy it is to have a grandpa who has dementia but im the only grand kid he never forgets even in his episodes. hospital staff even say “ahh you must be kalani his granddaughter he never stops asking for” 🥺

1690,1,@ASlapOfTruth1 @atomicgroundhog @CNN Dementia is a very broad term. Biden definitely does not have dementia.  My father displayed alarming behaviors.  How do you think Biden operates so well?  You have obviously not seen the dementia that I’ve seen.
1691,1,"@heathencandor One day at a time. I’ve been where you are—cared for my mom, who had dementia (at times she didn’t even know who I was). I had to step away from my career. But she’s gone now and I’m so glad I did it. Hang in there! 🙏🏻😘🤗"

1701,1,"@PinkBubbleHero || Who were you back then?? I’ve been here since 2015 &lt;3

The thing was that I was going through a lot at that point in my life. My grandmother has dementia and was put on trial for attempted murder, and I confided into him. He just,,, took advantage of me when I got infatuated."
1702,1,"I signed the end of life order for my mother, who had dementia, COPD and heart failure. She was discharged to her care home. The NHS paid the bills from then until her death a year later. But my father had paid them for the previous 2 years."

I took an early retirement to help my siblings care for my mom

1720,1,"I lost my mother just over six months ago after a battle with Alzheimer’s which lasted over a decade.  The last years she didn’t speak, except the time when I visited her to say goodbye before moving to the opposite coast.  I am still amazed she spoke and cherish that memory. ❤️"
1722,1,@Nanshomes @TomJChicago Hahaha! My Dad has dementia...POTUS Joe Biden doesn’t have dementia...goofy right wing name calling doesn’t change that. Covid45 is going downhill fast....there’s no one to cover up for him anymore. Q45 is hurtin’!

1727,1,"@MonaNeedsRock hi Mona I had my paternal grandmother in these conditions I was old enough to look after her together with my parents. I remember when she used horrible words and at other times she was so helpless. Dementia does not allow him to be more lucid and aware.

1803,1,@driscoll_dwayne I understand. I took care of my Mom alone before she passed in 2019. I was homebound with her because she had Alzheimer's/dementia and was also a fall risk.

1812,1,@GaleTStrong When my husband died his body went to a medical hospital for research. That's what he wanted.  Because he died from Alzheimer's I think that was important.  Hopefully  it will help those suffering from the disease in the future.  So organ donations are not the only choice.

2207,1,"@ilSharko Having seen my grandfather deal with it (and Alzheimer’s) and now see my grandmother dealing with it, it’s heart breaking to see. I might not like Joe Biden as President but he is a human being none-the less. And the stress that Presidents go through will only accelerate it."
2208,1,@TuckerGeri I am sorry for your sadness but you have been a wonderful daughter and I'm sure she knows in her heart.  My mom had Alzheimer's and was with me for 2 yrs before requiring 24/7 care. She knew my love for her and was my best friend.  She passed but wouldve turned 90 next week.
2209,1,"@patriottakes My mother had Alzheimers. From experience, I can say there is no way anyone can tell a dementia patient what to say or do."
2211,1,I know it will all work out but I always feel a responsibility to fix everything for everyone. I adore my grandmother. Seeing her go through dementia is a unique kind of torture. I owe it to her and to my family to help however I can.

2251,1,@AtoniB @roz_davies This is our experience too. My dad has dementia &amp; was admitted following a fall. No one from the family was allowed in &amp; he was unable to manage any phone or FT calls. Needless to say he slipped into delirium &amp; has rapidly declined.Mum has only been able to see him 2x. Shocking
2253,1,@aprilhenrybooks My grandmother didn't know her own children by the time she died. Same for my grandfather. Another relative has been suffering slow-motion dementia for 15 years. Ending up like that is one of my greatest fears.

2265,1,My grandfather losing himself to dementia and not even recognising or knowing who anyone in the family is anymore is effecting me on such a deep level. I regret not letting him know just how much he means to me. Please don't share in my regret if you can help it.
2267,1,"@RadioFreeTom I loathed Elvis growing up, especially his Christmas songs, which have a self-parody quality about them. I've been semi-converted by my mom, who's developed a late-stage affinity for select songs (e.g., ""I Can't Help Falling in Love...""). I blame the dementia."

2277,1,@devon_breeze Dementia is horrible. My Dad was left with vascular dementia after a minor stroke. Slowly his short term memory is getting worse &amp; he struggles to walk. Luckily he survived covid last Yr &amp; is now fully vaccinated. You just have be as patient as you can talking to him. Not easy
2278,1,"@Helenhs My mother suffers from dementia. She has been vaccinated. I read this headline to her and her response was, “Do I look like a damn potted plant! That’s just stupid!”"

Have a great day champ"
2285,1,@winerepublic It’s always sad when dementia intervenes and the person you knew is lost.  But it’s important to remember the good times and to reminisce.  My father died in 1983 - the centenary of his birth is this October and we’re going to celebrate that with my Mum!
2286,1,My mother most definitely has early onset Alzheimer’s. I wasn’t ready to lose my mom so soon.
2287,1,"""It doesn't matter what you bear, but how you bear it."" -Seneca  
When it comes to my mother's Alzheimer's, the only thing I can control is my focus. Once it shifted to my love for her, for my family, and once I embraced the idea of impermanence, grief was unable to cripple me."
2288,1,@roz_davies Whilst my mum (w dementia) was in local hosp for a week last June we weren’t even allowed to speak to her. They just said no. She was never the same once out. She died in October. 😢. Disgusting care. Sister on ward apologised when I finally got her hold of her after a week
