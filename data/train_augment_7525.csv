I love my stepdad for caring for her in their home until the end. What a courageous man, he's had Parkinson's for the last 3 years!
I love you Mom and Michael! ♥️ https://t.co/Jy0g3NGLC7"
198,1,@DVLAgovuk Your service is practically unusable if you have a problem that doesn’t fit a ‘tick box’. My mother is 91 with Alzheimer’s and you’re going to take her to court over non taxation of a car she hasn’t driven for two years. It’s on her drive. #impossibletotalktoDVLA
199,1,"@HatinHate @freshwaterpurl Yesterday I spent 20 minutes looking for the perfect card for my Mom. She's 91, is blind, &amp; has Alzheimer's. She didn't recognize me when I went to give it to her, but I read it to her &amp; told her I love her.

Please tell your Mom you love her while she's still able to feel it. 💝"

208,1,"@ManiacalV So great.  
I am convinced that my Grandma lived in 1964 for her Alzheimer's period.  Her youngest son was still alive (died at 16), her Mom and siblings lived in same town, I was not yet alive.  
I was happy to be a nice person in her life, once in a blue moon have her know me."

219,1,"@FoxNews My wife, with dementia, gets her medical exam Thursday. The blood work routinely shows that she's in very good health. It does not reflect the deficits in her memory or other cognitive abilities. Biden will probably get a 'pass' by the docs for similar reasons: no cognitive test."

237,1,@Marth27 and your family. My mom also suffered from frontal lobe dementia she too was 69 when she passed away. It is the saddest thing a person can go thru to watch their mom the person who has been there all your life slip away. Love ❤️ sweet girl!
238,1,"Hey @USAA, spending an hour on the phone with you trying to unsuccessfully pay insurance bill for 87-year-old mother-in-law with dementia was just wonderful. Thanks so much for the awesome service. Note to self: never use @USAA for my own insurance."
239,1,@deaflibertarian We went through exactly that with my mom. It was excruciating but she finally calmed down once on the appropriate medication. A doctor well-versed in dementia issues should be able to help you with this.

284,1,@coaimpaul That's very true as I made numerous visits to the hospital to be by my dad's side who had dementia. The care home did not even send anyone to accompany him when he was in A&amp;E. It can be very confusing for him as well as the NHS staff who weren't able to get information from him

1286,1,@rhymingmisfit I had one for my deceased mum. She had Alzheimer’s and they kept bothering her. We warned them away but they would phone her to meet at the post office while she collected her pension.  We have no idea what she did with the money she supposedly borrowed.

1293,1,"@DailyCaller I remember my Dad’s onset of dementia. He was good in small groups, areas were he was comfortable. In large family gatherings he would get confused and often say unrelated things to any conversation that was going on. An outburst of anger out of the blue. Anyone come to mind."

He said he’d leave it with them and said “Try harder”. I’m afraid they’ll de-list him for ‘abuse’ but he’s 91 looking after mum (dementia and more )&amp; he needs support.
1443,1,@Chris4Perkins Please make sure all they do is dementia care. My mom became combative and violent during her journey w/ dementia. She punched someone bc she was being held back. The facility kicked her out. New place allowed patients to roam as they pleased. Sedatives are an option. ❤️

1452,1,@MalindaBWhite @alzassociation Thank you. My #dementia mom now lives in a nursing home. She still needs protection and deserves dignity like all with dementia.
1456,1,kind of strange... my mother is unique.  My friend's mom has alzheimer's and she totally forgot English and went back to Farsi/Dari.   My mom has onset dementia and now she answers my questions in English instead of Fari/Dari.  My friend's mom was the one who was very fluent.

1460,1,"@JKosuth @FirewifeyOG1 This is a testament to how powerful language can be, and how we each truly speak our own language. I’m so glad it gathers and sustains you. When my dad got Alzheimer’s, it became a hard aphorism for me to bear, although it was technically true."

1497,1,"@TrinityMustache That describes my mom.  She was broken and had a hard time receiving or giving love until her later years when she developed dementia and then she became a different, wonderful  person.  The things that can facilitate healing a relationship can be odd and totally unexpected."
1498,1,This is a tough one - I disassociate when I get stressed &amp; “forgetting” is a sign I need to think deeper about why I am getting triggered. My mom has dementia. When she forgets it’s because her brain is betraying her. Knowing others assume I forget because I don’t care enough😬😳
1499,1,"Yesterday, I finally got to see my 90 year old grandmother who has severe dementia. She’s met Mercy only once (2 months old),so this was her second time meeting her (she forgot).

1991,1,"@pqben42 Absolutely.  After watching my father’s descent into dementia, I am a firm believer in death with dignity. I don’t want to go through what he did, I don’t want to put my children through that, and I don’t want them to remember me that way.

Why shouldn’t I have a dignity option?"
1992,1,@AdamParkhomenko I will finally go see my mom this summer.  Haven’t seen her since last February.   Her dementia is progressing fast.   I miss her so much.  She’s almost 94.  Also hubby &amp; I celebrating 40th anniversary with trip to Las Vegas we cancelled last year.

1997,1,@mscharliegirl75 That’s rough.  My father in law has Alzheimer’s and dad has type B Lymphoma.  Makes me think of how I want to go. I don’t want to linger.  I haven’t yet had to be an advocate for a decision like you had to be.
1998,1,"@aubreystrobel I was caretaker for my dad who had dementia. He passed away on April 5th. I know full well how difficult and tiresome it is to take care of someone with dementia. Even though I don't know her, from your words your mom is an angel."

2009,1,@crankyuncle2 When we were navigating my dad’s dementia we would tell “lies” that would make him happy or calm. We went along with his belief that his mom was still alive for example. Seems like this would just make her sad. Seems unkind to me. But maybe there’s more to the story.

2568,1,@InADash I’ve done ethnography and still didn’t do this with either parent. As their memory faded with dementia I was so mad at myself. I’d love to hear my dad sing “Every Day I Have the Blues” and tell me about jazz in NYC. Or my mom call me Nena and tell me about her childhood on a farm
2569,1,"@JohnCampaign This article is truly shocking. My own experience when my mother was diagnosed with dementia was the care workers came round and their first question was what assets she had. After that my Dad, myself and my now wife looked after her till she died 6 years later in hospital."

Dreading it.

2790,1,@Paulapulooza @sarahkbingler I bet it does. It would be hard to stomach if your aim was to provide the best care possible. Especially for seniors.

She's in a nursing home, fully vaccinated (as am I), but rules still require us to stay masked, 6 ft apart, twice a week. She has dementia and is on a downhill slide. Time is ticking for us. https://t.co/7pq1p5Psb1"

3228,1,@atrupar My mum hardly slept at night when her dementia started to take hold. I’m not surprised trump was up all night.
3230,1,@TJOshie77 My prayers are with you and your family. I lost my father and grandfather to Alzheimer's. It's not easy.
3232,1,@MoeMcDermott It's so gross. My mum died in an ON LTC 16 yrs ago. I won't name the company. They were so understaffed that my elderly father went every day to basically care for her. She had early onset Alzheimer's and was only 65 when she died. Her room was robbed after they took her body.
3233,1,@PaulaJaneB @BelTel That’s really concerning. We bury my dad tomorrow. He was diagnosed with Alzheimers 3yrs ago. It was just a few weeks from the GP referral to seeing the specialist. He was on meds fairly quickly too. Those 3yrs have been tough but we’re grateful we had them. 😢

3246,1,There are actually people who voted no on this.  Having my mom suffer from dementia is one of the worst things to ever happen to me.  I basically lost the mom I knew and moved and now have a shell of her left.  A helpless shell.  It’s a terrible disease.

3256,1,My mother didn't sleep &amp; she had FTD. Doctors called it SUNDOWNING. Scientists think that changes in the brain of someone with dementia might affect their inner “body clock.” The area of the brain that signals when you're awake or asleep breaks down in people with Alzheimer's.

3434,1,"@ThisisDavina @Channel4 I did, thank you. The stuff about low oestrogen levels and dementia is concerning. My Mum had a hysterectomy in her early 40s, no follow up, subsequent osteoporosis and later Alzheimers. I wonder what would have happened with proper care … 😿"
3435,1,"@spillthepearl I’ve been on both sides (had to help Mum who has DEMENTIA sort out “volunteering” with Vinnies at 64 y.o &amp; I was also employed as a paid store assistant there). And let me tell you, it’s an absolute bullshit business model they run there."
3436,1,@walk4alzheimers Heidi this is just wonderful. Amazing effort and I’ve donated. My mother has early-onset Alzheimer’s that robbed us of a beautiful soul in her 50’s. What you’re doing is inspirational and simply brilliant. Well done 👍🏽👌🙏🏽👏🏼❤️

3445,1,@yashar My mom died January 22.  Exactly one year after my dad.  I was the sole caregiver for them both.  Dad died of Alzheimer's and my mom of COPD.  My dog died.  I am so constipated with grief I haven't even cried.  I'm am too consumed with estate settlement.  Mother's day is sad.

3465,1,Thank you for all the prayers &amp; well wishes for my Mom. She is still in the hospital. She has been diagnosed with vascular dementia. She does not recognize my brother or know when her birthday is. We r very sad. She has lived 81 great years but the rest is not gonna b so good.
3466,1,"My mom was essentially unable to work long after 65, her body was too beat from a lifetime of work.

3474,1,"@MO_CAME4FUN I rented out my place &amp; cared for both my father (ALS) &amp; mother (Alzheimer’s). My father passed away &amp; I ended up selling my place &amp; stayed.

3609,1,@Lifeline24 your heavy handed tactics are a disgrace when your customers are so vulnerable. Your promise to stop the harassing phone calls to recover your equipment from my Mother (who has Alzheimer’s) was short lived as you have just taken the money out of her account.

3622,1,This is so powerful. A few days ago the anniversary of my Dad’s death passed. He’s dead 5 years now but dementia robbed him of his last 7 years of life. I was fortunate to have been able to help him but it drained so much from me physically &amp; emotionally. I miss him 💚
3626,1,Yes. If terminal or of a certain age and diagnosed with something like Alzheimer’s. I watched my mother get locked inside her own mind. I told my hubby if I am ever diagnosed with it he best move me to a state that allows it I don’t want to be a prisoner of myself.

3964,1,@Jdavis_Halton I share your dementia journey. I'm fortunate my mother is the reverse of how she was all of my life. This has made her softer.

4314,1,"On Mother's Day, for all those with a mother suffering dementia or Alzheimer's, know deep inside that the love you shared is still inside her.@alzassociation @BostonGlobe. I see that sparkle in my mom's eyes when she will remember my name."
4315,1,@EBraeden My mom has dementia.. a terrible horrible disease that tears families apart.
4316,1,"Happy #MothersDay mom. Here we were in Arlington VA, with not a clue how our lives would go! Mom’s wrestling with dementia and many health problems these days, so every moment is precious! Don’t waste a second. https://t.co/rD6vxTg77f"
4317,1,@gracefulwraith Yes I miss mom she suffered so much though with Alzheimer's still I wish she was here healthy though
4320,1,"Btw it was a super hard choice between dementia Aus and Beyond Blue, ultimately I went with Dementia Aus becuase of my grandma but I'll do more charity streams in the future"
4321,1,"@mrwib @Baddiel I wonder this all the time, especially now that my mother has very advanced Alzheimer’s."
4322,1,"@PadmaLakshmi My mom died last September from dementia. I miss her. 

This mother's day is not as bright because I'd so many mom's we have lost."
4323,1,"@freckled_frack Man, I won't be able to take it when my parents finish slipping into dementia. I know my mom is going to be babbling off defense lawyer points of the Derek Chauvin trial when her mind goes. My dad will probably be screaming that ""antifa"" took his hearing aids. They suck already."
4324,1,@PeterEgan6 @rickygervais @EganMyra We lost our mother in September. Our dear dad lost his life mate of over 66 years. She had FTD dementia. When she died he closed down and never spoke of her. It broke our hearts. He is now in hospital at 86 with dementia and urosepsis and says where is your mother. Its love
4325,1,@CajunBlueAZ1 @pqben42 It’s just not that simple. But yes if you want to go and you can say it then sure. But most elderly people with dementia or Parkinson’s are not able to grasp this. I watched my dad. I knew he wasn’t happy.
4327,1,@DEFendFURiously Dying before my Mom. I am from a family of three boys. My younger brother died of an OD in 2018 at 53 yrs old. My Dad died in 2019 from dementia. My older brother died in 2020 from stomach/liver cancer 4 days after diagnosis at 59 yrs. I am 57. I am her only reason for living.
